## Executive Summary

This comprehensive report provides exhibition-wide analytics covering visitor engagement, exhibitor performance, sector analysis, and geographic insights. All metrics are derived from visitor search interactions and exhibitor data.

---

## 1. Active Visitors (Who Searched)

**Description:** Total number of unique visitors who performed at least one exhibitor search during the exhibition. This represents engaged visitors actively exploring exhibitors.

**Calculation:** Counts distinct `visitor_uuid` values from the `visitor_exhibitor` table.

**SQL Logic:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visitor_uuid) as active_visitors
FROM visitor_exhibitor
```

**Result:** 67 active visitors

---

## 2. Total Registered Visitors

**Description:** Total number of visitors registered in the system with `is_active = 1`. This represents the full visitor base, regardless of search activity.

**Calculation:** Counts all rows in `visitors` table where `is_active = 1`.

**SQL Logic:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_visitors 
FROM visitors 
WHERE is_active = 1
```

**Result:** 42 total registered visitors

---

## 3. Total Searches Performed

**Description:** Total number of exhibitor search interactions across all visitors. Each row in `visitor_exhibitor` represents one search/appearance.

**Calculation:** Counts all rows in the `visitor_exhibitor` table.

**SQL Logic:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_searches 
FROM visitor_exhibitor
```

**Result:** 1051 total searches

---

## 4. Search Engagement Rate

**Description:** Percentage of registered visitors who actively searched for exhibitors. Measures overall visitor engagement with the exhibitor directory.

**Calculation:** `(active_visitors / total_visitors) * 100`

- **Engagement Rate:** 159.52%

**Interpretation:** Higher percentages indicate more active visitor participation in exhibitor discovery.

---

       COUNT(*) as search_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT ve.visitor_uuid) as unique_visitors
FROM visitor_exhibitor ve

FROM exhibitor e
LEFT JOIN visitor_exhibitor ve ON e.uuid = ve.exhibitor_id
WHERE ve.exhibitor_id IS NULL
LIMIT 10
