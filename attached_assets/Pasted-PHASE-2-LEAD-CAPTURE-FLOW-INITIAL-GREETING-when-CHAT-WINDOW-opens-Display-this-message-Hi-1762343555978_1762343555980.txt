PHASE 2: LEAD CAPTURE FLOW

INITIAL GREETING (when CHAT WINDOW opens):
Display this message:
"Hi there! 👋 Welcome to [Event Name]! I'm Faris, your event guide.

To help me assist you better, may I know your name and email address? This way I can provide you with personalized recommendations and keep you updated about the event.

You can share it like: 'I'm John from john@example.com' or simply type your details below."

Add two action buttons:
- "Share My Details" button
- "Skip for Now" button

LEAD CAPTURE METHODS:

METHOD 1 - Direct Capture (when "Share My Details" clicked):
Show inline form in chat with fields:
- Name* (text input, required)
- Email* (email input, required) 
- Company (text input, optional)
- Role (dropdown: Visitor/Exhibitor, optional)
- Submit button
Add disclaimer: "We respect your privacy. Your information will only be used for event-related communication."

METHOD 2 - Conversational Capture (during chat):
Implement NLP to detect when users naturally share information:
- Pattern: "I'm [Name]" or "My name is [Name]"
- Pattern: "My email is [email]" or "[email address]"
- Pattern: "I work at [Company]" or "I'm from [Company]"
Extract and parse this information automatically

METHOD 3 - Contextual Trigger:
When user asks about: registration, booking, exhibitor details, scheduling, ticket purchase
Trigger message: "I'd love to help you with that! To send you the details and keep you updated, could you share your name and email address?"

PHASE 3: DATA VALIDATION & STORAGE

EMAIL VALIDATION:
- Use regex to validate email format: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
- Show error if invalid: "That doesn't look like a valid email. Could you check and try again?"
- After successful capture, confirm: "Got it! I've saved your details as [Name] - [Email]. Is this correct?"
- Allow user to edit if incorrect

DATABASE SCHEMA:
Create table/collection named "leads" with these fields:
{
  id: UUID (auto-generated primary key),
  name: STRING (required),
  email: STRING (required, unique),
  company: STRING (nullable),
  role: STRING (nullable, values: "Visitor" or "Exhibitor"),
  captured_at: TIMESTAMP (auto-generated),
  captured_via: STRING (values: "direct", "conversational", "contextual"),
  conversation_id: STRING (link to chat session ID),
  user_type: STRING (from Visitor/Exhibitor selection),
  lead_category: STRING (nullable),
  source_page: STRING (track originating page URL)
}

DUPLICATE HANDLING:
- Before saving, check if email exists in database
- If exists: Display "Welcome back, [Name]! I remember you. How can I help you today?"
- If new: Save lead and show confirmation message

PHASE 4: BACKEND API ENDPOINTS

Create these endpoints:

POST /api/leads
Body: { name, email, company?, role?, phone?, captured_via, conversation_id, user_type?, source_page? }
Response: { success: true, lead: {...} } or { success: false, error: "message" }

GET /api/leads/check/:email
Response: { exists: true/false, lead: {...} or null }

PUT /api/leads/:id
Body: { name?, email?, company?, role?, phone? }
Response: { success: true, lead: {...} }

GET /api/leads (admin only - add authentication)
Response: { leads: [...], count: number }

PHASE 5: AUTO-CATEGORIZATION LOGIC

Implement conversation analysis to tag leads based on topics discussed:
- If asks about registration/tickets → lead_category: "registration_interest"
- If asks about exhibiting/booth → lead_category: "exhibitor_interest"
- If asks about sessions/speakers → lead_category: "content_interest"  
- If asks about sponsorship → lead_category: "sponsorship_interest"
- If asks about general info → lead_category: "general_inquiry"

Update lead_category field in database when category is detected

PHASE 6: USER FLOW SCENARIOS

SCENARIO 1 - Immediate Capture:
User opens chat → Sees greeting → Clicks "Share My Details" → Fills form → Submits → Sees confirmation → Continues to normal chat

SCENARIO 2 - Skip Initially:
User opens chat → Sees greeting → Clicks "Skip for Now" → Starts asking questions → High-intent detected → Contextual prompt appears → User shares details → Continues chat

SCENARIO 3 - Natural Conversation:
User opens chat → Clicks "Skip for Now" → Types "Hi I'm Sarah from sarah@company.com" → Bot detects and extracts info → Confirms with user → Saves to database

SCENARIO 4 - Returning User:
User opens chat with same browser/device → System checks for existing conversation_id or prompts for email → Finds existing lead → Shows "Welcome back, [Name]!" → Skips lead capture

PHASE 7: ERROR HANDLING

Handle these cases gracefully:
- Invalid email format → Show friendly error and request correction
- Database connection failure → Show "Having trouble saving your info. You can continue chatting and we'll try again later."
- User refuses to share info → Allow chat to continue normally with limited functionality
- Duplicate email submission → Recognize returning user instead of showing error
- Empty required fields → Show validation message: "Please fill in your name and email to continue"

PHASE 8: PRIVACY & COMPLIANCE

Add these elements:
- Privacy disclaimer below lead capture form
- Optional checkbox: "I agree to receive event updates via email"
- Link to privacy policy (if available)
- Allow users to opt-out or delete their data (implement in future admin panel)

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

- Keep existing chat bubble styling and color scheme
- Tab navigation should be clean and not cluttered
- Lead capture form should feel native to the chat interface (chat-style, not popup)
- Use smooth transitions and animations
- Maintain mobile responsiveness
- Keep input field and action buttons at bottom of screen
- Ensure proper spacing and readability

TESTING CHECKLIST:

Test these before marking complete:
□ Tab navigation works and Chat tab is default
□ Greeting message appears when chat opens
□ "Share My Details" button shows inline form
□ "Skip for Now" button allows user to continue chatting
□ Email validation works correctly
□ Lead data saves to database successfully
□ Duplicate email detection works
□ Conversational NLP extraction works for name/email
□ Contextual trigger appears at appropriate times
□ Returning user recognition works
□ Form displays correctly on mobile and desktop
□ All API endpoints return correct responses
□ Error handling works for all edge cases

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
This is PRIORITY 1 feature. Complete and test thoroughly before implementing Journey, Referral, or Radar tabs.

DELIVERABLES:
1. Updated chatbot UI with tab navigation
2. Working lead capture with all 3 methods (direct, conversational, contextual)
3. Database table/collection with proper schema
4. API endpoints for lead management
5. Email validation and duplicate checking
6. Confirmation messages and error handling
7. Mobile-responsive design
