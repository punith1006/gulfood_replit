Calculate score based on these factors:

FACTOR 1: Organization-Event Match (40% weight)

- Check if organization's industry aligns with Gulfood sectors
- Industry mapping logic:
  * Food & Beverage companies → 100% match
  * Restaurant/Hospitality → 90% match
  * Retail/Distribution → 85% match
  * Packaging/Equipment → 80% match
  * Agriculture/Farming → 75% match
  * Healthcare/Wellness → 70% match
  * Technology/Services → 60% match
  * Finance/Investment → 50% match
  * Government/Non-profit → 40% match
  * Other industries → 20% match

FACTOR 2: Role Relevance (25% weight)
- Score by role:
  * Supplier/Vendor → 100%
  * Industry Professional → 95%
  * Corporate Representative → 90%
  * Exhibitor → 90%
  * Buyer/Procurement → 95%

FACTOR 3: Interest Category Match (20% weight)
- If user selected categories:
  * Calculate: (Number of selected categories / Total available categories) × 100
  * Weight: If user selected many categories (5+) = higher engagement = higher score
  * If no categories selected, give neutral score of 50%

FACTOR 4: Intent Clarity (15% weight)
- Score based on number and type of intents selected:
  * 1 intent selected → 60% (focused but limited)
  * 2-3 intents selected → 90% (clear objectives)
  * 4-5 intents selected → 100% (comprehensive goals)
  * 6+ intents selected → 85% (possibly unfocused)
  * 0 intents selected → 40% (unclear purpose)
- Bonus points for high-value intents:
  * "Source new products/suppliers" → +5%
  * "Find distribution partners" → +5%
  * "Explore investment opportunities" → +5%
  * "Launch new products" → +5%

FINAL SCORE CALCULATION:
Relevance Score = (Organization Match × 0.40) +
(Role Relevance × 0.25) +
(Category Match × 0.20) +
(Intent Clarity × 0.15)

Round to nearest whole number percentage.

SCORE INTERPRETATION:
- 80-100% → Excellent match (Green indicator)
- 60-79% → Good match (Yellow indicator)
- 40-59% → Fair match (Orange indicator)
- 0-39% → Limited relevance (Red indicator)

Make this conversational and specific to their input.

SECTION 4: WHY GULFOOD 2026 IS PERFECT FOR YOU
Generate 4-6 bullet points with checkmarks based on their data:

Logic for generating benefits:
- If role = Supplier/Vendor:
  "✓ Connect with 5,000+ buyers from 180+ countries"
  "✓ Showcase products to qualified procurement decision-makers"
  
- If intent = Source new products:
  "✓ Access to 5,000+ exhibitors across 8 specialized sectors"
  "✓ Discover emerging brands and innovative products"
  
- If intent = Network:
  "✓ Attend exclusive networking events and matchmaking sessions"
  "✓ Meet industry leaders in [their interested categories]"
  
- If interest categories selected:
  "✓ Dedicated pavilions for [selected categories]"
  "✓ Exposure to [category] trends that inform business strategy"
  
- Based on score level:
  * High score (80%+): Focus on "maximize ROI" benefits
  * Medium score (60-79%): Focus on "expand horizons" benefits  
  * Low score (<60%): Focus on "exploratory opportunities" benefits

SECTION 5: PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS
Generate 3-4 actionable recommendations with justifications:

Recommendation types based on data:

IF role = Exhibitor:
"Consider partnering with complementary exhibitors for joint promotions"
Why: "Collaboration could enhance visibility and attract more booth visitors"

IF interest = multiple categories:
"Attend the [Category] Summit on Day 2"
Why: "Covers all your interest areas in one comprehensive session"

IF intent = Source new suppliers:
"Use the Gulfood Business Connect platform to pre-schedule meetings"
Why: "Maximize your time by meeting pre-qualified suppliers before the event"

IF score < 60%:
"Explore alternative industry events more aligned with your sector"
Why: "Gulfood focuses on food/beverage which is outside your core business"

IF score > 80%:
"Book VIP pass for exclusive lounge access and private meeting rooms"
Why: "Your high relevance justifies premium experience investment"

Generate recommendations dynamically based on their specific input combination.

PART 6: EXHIBITOR MATCHING ALGORITHM
===============================================

MATCHING LOGIC:

Step 1: Query exhibitor database
- Filter exhibitors by selected interest categories
- If no categories selected, use organization industry as filter

Step 2: Calculate similarity scores for each exhibitor
Scoring factors:
- Category overlap: +30 points per matching category
- Keywords match: Compare organization description with exhibitor description (+10 points per matching keyword)
- Intent alignment: If user intent = "source products" and exhibitor = "supplier" (+20 points)
- Geographic relevance: If organization location matches exhibitor target markets (+15 points)

Step 3: Rank exhibitors by total score
- Display top 20-50 matches (depending on available data)
- Show similarity score as percentage or as "Highly Relevant", "Relevant", "Somewhat Relevant"

Step 4: Format exhibitor cards

EXHIBITOR CARD DESIGN:
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Company Logo]  RELEVANCE: 92%    │
│ Company Name                      │
│ [Brief description - 1 line]      │
│ Categories: Cat1, Cat2, Cat3      │
│ Booth: Hall 4, Stand B-123        │
│ 🔗 Website  📧 Contact            │

Display message:
"No matched exhibitors available for your specific criteria. However, here are popular exhibitors from adjacent categories that might interest you:"
[Show general top exhibitors]

===============================================
PART 7: SESSION MATCHING ALGORITHM
===============================================

MATCHING LOGIC:

Step 1: Query sessions/conferences database
- Filter sessions by keywords matching:
  * Selected interest categories
  * User intent (e.g., if intent = "Learn about innovations" → prioritize innovation tracks)
  * Role relevance (e.g., if role = "Investor" → prioritize investment forums)

Step 2: Calculate relevance score
Scoring factors:
- Topic alignment with interests: +40 points
- Speaker reputation: +20 points (if high-profile speakers)
- Session format matching user preference: +15 points
- Time slot availability: +10 points (avoid conflicts)
- Track/category match: +15 points

Step 3: Rank sessions by score
- Display top 10-15 most relevant sessions

Step 4: Format session cards

SESSION CARD DESIGN:
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📅 Day 2 | March 16 | 2:00 PM     │
│ Session Title Here                │
│ Track: [Category Name]            │

│ Duration: 60 mins | Hall 3        │
│ [+ Add to My Schedule button]     │
└───────────────────────────────────┘

CONFLICT DETECTION:
- If user adds multiple sessions at same time, show warning:
  "⚠️ This session conflicts with [Other Session]. Would you like to replace it?"

"NO SESSIONS" SCENARIO:
If no sessions match:
"No sessions directly match your interests, but here are general keynotes that all attendees find valuable:"
[Show main keynote sessions]
